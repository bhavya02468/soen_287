        <p>Here you can include general instructions on how to care for a dog. Topics might include feeding, exercise, grooming, and training. Be sure to credit any sources if you're using external content.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Regular Exams are Vital</strong><br>Just like you, your pet can get heart problems, develop arthritis, or have a toothache. The best way to prevent such problems or catch them early is to see your veterinarian every year. Regular exams are the single most important way to keep pets healthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Spay and Neuter Your Pets</strong><br>Eight million to 10 million pets end up in U.S. shelters every year. Spaying and neutering don’t just cut down on the number of unwanted pets; it also lowers the risk of certain cancers and reduces a pet’s risk of getting lost.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevent Parasites</strong><br>Fleas are the most common external parasite that can plague pets, leading to irritated skin, hair loss, hot spots, and infection. Year-round prevention is key.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Weight</strong><br>Many dogs and cats are overweight or obese. Overfeeding is the leading cause of obesity. Pets need far fewer calories than most of us think—talk to your vet for feeding suggestions based on your pet’s needs.  Overfeeding is the leading cause of obesity, says Douglas, who adds that keeping our pets trim can add years to their lives. Because pets need far fewer calories than most of us think — as little as 185-370 a day for a small, inactive dog; just 240-350 calories daily for a 10-pound cat — talk to your vet, who can make feeding suggestions based on your pet’s age, weight, and lifestyle.</li>
        
           
            <li><strong>Get Regular Vaccinations</strong><br>For optimal health, pets need regular vaccinations against diseases such as rabies, distemper, feline leukemia, and canine hepatitis.How often your dog or cat needs to be immunized depends on their age, lifestyle, health, and risks so talk to your vet about the vaccinations that make sense for your pet.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Provide an Enriched Environment</strong><br> An enriched environment is another key to the long-term health and welfare of your canine and feline friend Pets need mental stimulation which may mean daily walks for your pooch, and scratching posts, window perches, and toys for your cat. It means play time with you, which not only keeps your pet’s muscles toned and boredom at bay, it also strengthens your bond with your four-footed companions.</li>
            
           
            <li><strong>Microchip and Tattoo Your Pet</strong><br>Lack of identification means as few as 14% of pets ever find their way home after getting lost. Fortunately, microchipping and/or tattooing can allow for the pet to be reunited with its. About the size of a rice grain, a microchip is inserted under the skin in less than a second. It needs no battery and can be scanned by a vet or an animal control officer in seconds.</li>
